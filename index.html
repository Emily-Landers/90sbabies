    <h4>George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Yeah. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. What? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. I hope so. You'll find out. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?</h4>
